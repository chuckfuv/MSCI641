This is the code for the default project.

I did not include the pre-trained GlOVE word embedding because its too big.

The word embedding can be download at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

The version of the embedding I use is:

Common Crawl (42B tokens, 1.9M vocab, uncased, 300d vectors, 1.75 GB download): glove.42B.300d.zip
